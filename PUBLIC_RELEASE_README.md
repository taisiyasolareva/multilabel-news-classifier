# Public release snapshot

This folder was generated by `scripts/make_public_snapshot.py`.

It intentionally excludes:
- local datasets
- local virtual environments
- model weights / checkpoints (publish weights as release assets instead)
- logs (wandb/, monitoring/predictions/, etc.)

## Publish

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial public release"
```

Then create a new GitHub repo and push this folder.
